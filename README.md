## Assignment Description

**a) Write an agent from scratch using tools in python**  <br>
In this example, the ArithmeticAgent class defines a simple agent capable of performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The respond method takes an operation and a variable number of arguments, performing the requested operation on the arguments.


**b) Write demonstrations of various agent types with langchain as colab** <br>
LangChain is a framework for building agents that can use language models to perform tasks. Demonstrating various agent types with LangChain involves creating a notebook that showcases different capabilities, such as conversational agents, information retrieval agents, etc. This example includes an OpenAi Chat Function  Agent, XML Agent, JSON Agent, and ReAct Agent
